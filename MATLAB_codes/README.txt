---> 'RMPSS.m' is the code for Recursive Modified Pattern Search on Simplex
      WITHOUT using parallel threading.


---> 'RMPSS_parallel.m' is the code for Recursive Modified Pattern Search on Simplex
      using parallel threading.


---> In this particular example scenario, the objective function is NOT expensive 
     enough, which is why the parallel computing might take more time than single thread
     computation.
